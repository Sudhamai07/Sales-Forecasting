# Sales Forecasting using Linear Regression

## 📑 Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple sales forecasting model using Linear Regression. It utilizes historical monthly sales data to predict future sales. The model is built with Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Features

- Train a Linear Regression model on historical sales data.
- Predict future sales for upcoming months.
- Visualize the regression line along with actual and predicted sales.
- Evaluate model accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
